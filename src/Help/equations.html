<p>Welcome the the Calculus 3D Solids Program!</p>
<p>There are certain guidelines for writing equations for this program. These guidelines are pretty simple, and by following them, the program can better understand what input it is given.</p>
<ul>
<li>Input the equations as you would into a normal calculator.</li>
<li>Do NOT surround the whole equation with parentheses. It's pointless and confuses the program.</li>
<li>Do NOT include spaces. It may look good on paper, but they carry no function in the equation.</li>
<li>For word operators (sin, abs, sqrt, tan, etc.), it is not necessary to include parentheses if the argument is just x. For example, sin(x) could be inputted as sinx, but sin(x^2) would have to be entered as sin(x^2).</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>The output isn't what I expected.</b> Check your equation, mainly the parentheses. It may help to write the equation down on paper.</li>
<li><b>The program keeps telling me about a "syntax error."</b> Again, check your equation. Write it on paper; then put parentheses in the right places; then rewrite it in one line. Enter it into the program it <i>should</i> work then.</li>
<li><b>I tested the sytem of equations on paper and they form only one region, but the program says "No region formed" or "Multiple regions formed."</b> There are two possible causes: (1) Bug! Please save your configuration (File > Save) and email <a href="mailto:vetruvet@gmail.com">me</a>, with the configuration file (.c3s file) as an attachment. ---OR--- (2) The equation is "wild." If the function osciallates a lot around the point of intersection, the program might not be able to process that (yet). Things like sin(1/x^2) <i>may cause problems</i></li>
<li><b>When I put in ln(x) and graph it, the graph doesn't go all the way down...</b> Vertical asymptotes are a bit of an issue and I will try to work on that as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>
