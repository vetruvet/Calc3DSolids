<p>Welcome the the Calculus 3D Solids Program!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the equations are graphed, this may help you explore the graph.</p>
<ul>
<li>On both the 2D and 3D graph, use the mouse wheel to zoom. Scroll up, and the graph will zoom in, and vice-versa.</li>
<li>On both the 2D and 3D graph, click and drag with the right mouse button to pan the graph around.</li>
<li>On just the 3D graph, click and drag with the left mouse button to rotate the graph around. It may take a while to get used to rotating things in 3D.</li>
<li>On both the 2D and 3D graph, hit the 'R' key to reset the view back to its original. This is helpful if you get stuck somewhere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>The original view only shows black.</b> Try zooming out and panning around until you find an axis or the solid itself.</li>
<li><b>The discs, shells, or washers are really hard to see :(</b> I'm working on making it easier to see how the discs/shells/washers stack up against one another. Part of this is their appearance. Another part will be the ability to "animate" them stacking up. It might take some time for me...</li>
</ul>
