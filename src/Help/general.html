<p>Welcome the the Calculus 3D Solids Program!</p>
<p>These help files will (hopefully) help you understand how to use this program, and clear up any questions about its operation</p>
<p>This program is designed to demonstrate how solids of revolution and solids with known cross-sections are formed. With a 2D chalkboard, it is oftentimes hard to understand and demonstrate the concept of solids in Calculus. That's where this program comes in.</p>
<p>NOTE: This program is NOT a calculator!!! Don't expect it to give you the volume or area or whatever.</p>
<br />
<p>The basic usage of this program is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the equations. For tips on writing equations, please consult the <a href="equations.html">Equations</a> section.</li>
</ol>
<p> For <u>Solids of Revolution</u>: </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Enter the axis, including whether it's horizontal or vertical. Constants like PI and E can be used here.</li>
<li>Select the method of approximation, either discs/washers or shells.</li>
<li>Enter the number of discs/washers or shells to be shown.</li>
</ol>
<p> For <u>Solids with Known Cross-Sections</u>: </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select the shape for the cross-section</li>
<li>For shapes with a constant height, enter the height value. Constants like PI and E can be used here.</li>
<li>Select which axis the cross-sections are perpendicular to and how many cross-section cuts there should be.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Click the corresponding graph button to view a 2D or 3D graph for the given input. For tips of viewing the graphs, please consult the <a href="graphing.html">Graphing</a> section</li>
<li>Examine the graphs and experiment with different viewing angles</li>
</ol>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Where's the answer?!?</b> This program is NOT designed to spit out an answer. It is merely a tool to demonstrate the concept of solids of revolution</li>
<li><b>It keeps giving me errors about regions.</b> Check (on paper) to make sure that your equations don't result in more than one valid region.</li>
<li><b>The resulting region should be valid, but I still get errors</b> Eek! Bug! Please save your configuration (File &gt; Save) and email <a href="mailto:vetruvet@gmail.com">me</a>, with the configuration file (.c3s file) as an attachment.</li>
<li><b>What is the "solid of revolution", "disc", "washer", "shell" crap???</b> Why are you even using this program???</li>
</ul>
